            <h2>1. Agriculture</h2>
            <p>
                Shyamora is a city which lies in the banks of the Himalayas next to Dehradun. The region 
                benefits from fertile Doon Valley soil and an abundance of water resources. Here we can 
                focus on crops like basmati rice, wheat, and seasonal fruits. The cultivable land consists of both
                flat land and mountains, primarily terrace farming. Considering the potential growth, 
                the following measures are proposed.
            </p>
            <h3>Potential Growth:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainable farming: Going green with organic farming to reduce environmental degradation.</li>
                <li>Technology integration: Using technology to predict weather, assess soil quality, etc.</li>
                <li>Vertical farming: Efficient land use in urban areas.</li>
                <li>Agriculture hubs: Processing, packaging, and exporting produce.</li>
